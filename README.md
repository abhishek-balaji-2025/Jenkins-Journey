# Jenkins-Journey
Welcome to my Jenkins Journey! ðŸš€  This repository is a living log of everything I've learnedâ€”and will continue to learnâ€”about Jenkins, the powerful Continuous Integration (CI) tool. Here, I explore concepts, best practices, pipelines, plugins, automation techniques, and real-world use cases to deepen my understanding of Jenkins and its ecosystem.
